# EO_Portfolio
My professional portfolio displaying some of my sample projects.

# [Project_1 : Financial_Planner_Forecasting_cummilative_returns](https://github.com/EOndarza/Financial_Planner/tree/main)
*Created a Financial Planning tool that will forecast asset value performance over 30 year period.
*Utilizes an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get 3 years of historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.  
*Use MCForecastTools library to create a Monte Carlo simulation for users portfolio.  
*Plot and display Monte Carlo simulated forecast using plotly and seaborn libraries.

# [Project_2 : Fraudulant_transaction_detection](https://github.com/EOndarza/Fraudulant_transaction_detection/tree/main)
*Defined a database model to store the credit card transactions data and create a new PostgreSQL database using your model.  
*Created a database schema on PostgreSQL and populated database from raw data on CSV file.  
*Analysis of data to identify possible fraudulent transactions trends data, and develop a final report.

# [Project_3 : Bank CAP Model](https://github.com/EOndarza/CAP-Project/tree/main)
*Feed training data through a multiple linear regression model to find variables with highest coefficients for dependent variable "Exiting Customers." 
*Tune Model to achieve highest prediction accuracy using adjusted R-squared, decide on regressors. 
*Run test data through binary logit model, run forecast analysis to generate predictions using Gretl software. 
*Run results through CAP curve model to optimize probability to ensure bank first targets its customers that are predicted to be potential risk first.

# Project_4 : Solidity_SmartContract_JointSavings
*Created a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity, using 2 seperate account addresses that can deposit and withdrawl ETH.  
*Compiled and successfully deployed Smart Contract in the JavaScript Virtual Machine.   
*Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract on Gorli network(transfer funds, withdrawl, deposit, check balance etc.).
